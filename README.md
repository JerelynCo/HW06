#HW06 Fwappyberd  (deadline: 2015-03-03)

Write a Flappy Bird clone.

1. Apply gravity on the falling bird. Play with the values until you get what feels "right".
2. Use simple explicit Euler for integration.
3. Model the bird as an oriented bounding box which follows its velocity.
4. Use SAT to check for collisions.
5. Apply impulse when going up.
6. The level should be randomly generated.
